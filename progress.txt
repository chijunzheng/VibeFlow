## Session: Implementation of Stress Mode & Auto-Save

### Completed
- Feature F005: Stress Highlighting
  - Backend analyzes stress patterns via Gemini.
  - Frontend renders **bold** syllables in a separate view.
- Feature F011: Auto-Save
  - Implemented `SongUpdate` and `PUT` endpoint.
  - Frontend debounces saves (2s) and updates "Last saved" indicator.
  - Fixed accidental deletion of `create_song` endpoint during refactor.

### Sub-Agent Handoffs
- Coder (Self-Simulated):
  - Implemented backend and frontend logic for both features.
  - Resolved regression in `songs.py`.
  - Verified with tests.

### Context for Next Agent
- **Priority:**
  - F006: Rhyme Scheme Setup (Architect Agent).
  - F007: Anti-Cliché Filter.
- **Notes:**
  - The core editor is now very functional (Writes, Counts, Highlights, Saves).
  - Next steps focus on "refining" the output (Architecture/Rhymes and Quality/Cliché).

## File Summary
- backend/api/songs.py: Full song management
- backend/api/utils.py: Syllables & Stress
- frontend/src/app/songs/[id]/page.tsx: Robust Editor
