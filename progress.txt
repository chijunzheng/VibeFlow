## Session: Implementation of Anti-Cliché Filter

### Completed
- Feature F007: Anti-Cliché Filter
  - Established `backend/constants.py` as the source of truth for banned terms.
  - Reinforced `AIService` system instructions with an explicit list of prohibited clichés.
  - Added `check_cliches` utility to programmatically verify lyric quality.

### Sub-Agent Handoffs
- Coder (Self-Simulated):
  - Defined the banned words list based on common AI writing patterns.
  - Integrated the list into the Gemini Pro prompt for F003/F025.
  - Verified logic with tests.

### Context for Next Agent
- **Priority:**
  - F013/F014: Song Management (Delete/Rename) - Crucial for local persistence UX.
  - F008: Manual Edit - Verify and polish the existing auto-save for manual typing.
- **Notes:**
  - The Ghostwriter is now highly tuned for raw, modern songwriting.

## File Summary
- backend/constants.py: Banned AI-isms
- backend/ai.py: Updated Ghostwriter prompt
- backend/utils.py: Cliché check logic
