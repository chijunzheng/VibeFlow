## Session: Shortcuts & Resilience

### Completed
- Feature F023: Keyboard Shortcuts
  - Added global event listeners in the editor.
  - `Cmd+Enter`: Trigger Ghostwrite.
  - `Cmd+S`: Immediate Manual Save.
  - `Cmd+Shift+S`: Toggle Stress Highlighting.
- Feature F034: 404 Page
  - Created a custom `not-found.tsx` with VibeFlow's glassmorphic design.

### Sub-Agent Handoffs
- Coder (Self-Simulated):
  - Integrated keyboard listener with editor state.
  - Built a polished 404 page.

### Context for Next Agent
- **Priority:**
  - F028: Token Usage - Metadata tracking.
  - F031: DB Lock - Handle concurrent access (less critical for local lite, but good to have).
- **Notes:**
  - 94% of features complete.
