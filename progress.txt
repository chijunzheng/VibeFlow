## Session: Implementation of Core AI Features

### Completed
- Feature F024: API Key Config (Backend)
- Feature F001: Create New Song (Backend)
- Feature F002: Generate Vibe Cloud (Backend)
  - Implemented `backend/ai.py` with `AIService` using `google-genai`
  - Added `POST /songs/{id}/generate_vibe` endpoint
  - Mocked and tested AI integration in `tests/test_ai.py`

### Sub-Agent Handoffs
- Coder (Self-Simulated):
  - Implemented AI service and integrated with Song API.
  - Used Gemini Flash model for vibe generation.
  - Added tests mocking the AI service.

### Context for Next Agent
- **Priority:**
  - F016 (Sidebar Navigation) - Start Frontend implementation.
  - F003 (Draft Lyrics - Ghostwriter) - Next AI feature using Gemini Pro.
- **Notes:**
  - AI Service assumes `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model. Change in `backend/ai.py` if needed.
  - Frontend still needs to be connected.

## File Summary
- backend/ai.py: AI Service
- backend/api/songs.py: Song endpoints (updated)
- tests/test_ai.py: AI tests
