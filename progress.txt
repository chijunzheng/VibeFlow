## Session: Frontend Implementation

### Completed
- Feature F016: Sidebar Navigation (Frontend)
  - Created `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
  - Integrated `fetchSongs` and `createSong` API calls
  - Added "New Song" button
- Feature F032: Home Dashboard (Frontend)
  - Created `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` with welcome screen
- Song Editor Page (Integration of F001, F002, F003)
  - Created `frontend/src/app/songs/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Integrated `generateVibe` (F002)
  - Integrated `writeLyrics` (F003)
  - Visualized Vibe Cloud and Lyrics Editor

### Sub-Agent Handoffs
- Coder (Self-Simulated):
  - Built Frontend API client (`lib/api.ts`)
  - Built React components for Sidebar and Editor
  - Styled with Tailwind CSS and Glassmorphism principles

### Context for Next Agent
- **Priority:**
  - Verify end-to-end functionality (manually or via E2E tests if setup).
  - Implement F004 (Syllable Counter) - This requires `syllapy` on backend or frontend logic.
  - Implement F025 (Stream Response) - Update API to stream.
- **Notes:**
  - Frontend is ready to run on port 3000.
  - Backend is ready on port 8000.
