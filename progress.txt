## Session: Implementation of Syllable Counter & Streaming

### Completed
- Feature F004: Syllable Counter
- Feature F025: Stream Response
  - Backend `AIService` now supports `stream_lyrics`.
  - Frontend editor now streams lyrics in real-time, providing immediate feedback to the user.
  - Syllable counts update as the AI writes (due to the lyrics change trigger).

### Sub-Agent Handoffs
- Coder (Self-Simulated):
  - Implemented streaming logic on both backend and frontend.
  - Integrated the streaming response into the existing SongEditor.

### Context for Next Agent
- **Priority:**
  - F005: Stress Highlighting - Last major AI poetic feature.
  - F011: Auto-Save - Ensure manual edits are persisted.
- **Notes:**
  - Streaming uses `text/plain` for simplicity.
  - The `loadSong` call after streaming ensures the frontend is in sync with the final persisted state in the DB.

## File Summary
- backend/ai.py: Added streaming support
- backend/api/songs.py: Added streaming endpoint
- frontend/src/app/songs/[id]/page.tsx: Implemented stream consumption
