## Session: Feedback & Visual Polish

### Completed
- Feature F018: Thinking Indicator
  - Created a custom pulsing and pinging indicator for AI states.
  - Placed it prominently in the header during generation.
- Feature F022: Toast Notifications
  - Implemented a lightweight `ToastContext`.
  - Added success/error feedback for all major user actions (Rename, Vibe, Lyrics, Copy).
- UI Polish
  - Enhanced glassmorphic effects with `shadow-xl`, `backdrop-blur`, and subtle borders.
  - Improved input fields with `shadow-inner` and focus rings.

### Sub-Agent Handoffs
- Coder (Self-Simulated):
  - Built the notification infrastructure and thinking state visuals.
  - Integrated everything into the main Editor flow.

### Context for Next Agent
- **Priority:**
  - F026: Model Switching - Allow user to toggle between Flash and Pro (Thinking) explicitly? The spec says Flash for vibes, Pro for writing. Maybe add a toggle for "Creative Intensity".
  - F027: Thought Signature Storage - Persistence of AI context.
- **Notes:**
  - Over 50% of features are now complete.

## File Summary
